Detect whether an image is AI-generated or human-made using ML models. 
This project explores machine learning models for detecting AI-generated images with a focus on achieving high precision and F1 scores (~80%).
After comparison, the strongest performing one is determined as the new baseline model for future training.

1. Install requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Train the model:
```
python train.py
```

3. Test the model
```
python test.py
```

4. Evaluate the model:
```
python evaluate.py
```

This project demonstrates how machine learning can help distinguish fact from fabrication in a world where AI-generated media is everywhere.
